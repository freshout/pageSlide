# PageSlide jQuery plugin

Open your external links in a slide and stay on your original site.

You can **navigate** through all the links that you specify without closing the slide.
And you have buttons to **copy** or **view** the original URL, and a **facebook sharer button**.

## Disclaimer

There are some sites that detect they're being opened from an iframe, and they will redirect you to the
original site in the top window.

## Example

Just bind the plugin to the links you want to open in a slide:

`$('.pageSlide').pageSlide({height: '85%', modal: true, bookmarkers: false})`

You can pass a set of options to customize:

* `height` The height of the slide.
* `bookmarkers` Wether or not you want to show the right facebook button to share the url.
* `label` Text to display on the back arrow.
* `duration` Speed of animation.
* `direction` Direction of the animation (top or bottom).
* `opacity` Opacity of the modal overlay.
* `collectionSelector` CSS selector to fetch all the links you want to navigate through.
* `copyUrlImgPath` Path to the image of the copy url button.
* `viewOrigImgPath` Path to the image of the view original button.

**Note** You need to include the zeroClipboard plugin as well to make the copy URL button work.
